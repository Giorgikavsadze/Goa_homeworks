# 5) Tuple Methods: Use the .count() and .index() methods on a tuple containing repeated elements to count occurrences and find the first occurrence of a specific value

tuple = (1, 3, 3, 6, 6)

count_3 = tuple.count(3)
count_6 = tuple.count(6)

index_3 = tuple.index(3)
index_6 = tuple.index(6)

print(count_3)
print(count_6)
print(index_3)
print(index_6)
